This is my first project.
I am in the journey to become a front-end developer and as a former teacher I know how much practicing is important when learning new skills.

My goal here was to apply what I have learned with TreeHouse and create a static website with HTML5 and CSS3. To speed up the process I decided to code from scratch a template I found on http://templatation.com/

Skills practised:
- HTML 5 / CSS 3
- dropdown menu
- dynamic pseudo-classes
- CSS transitions
- parallax scrolling

All feedbacks are welcome and appreciated! :)
